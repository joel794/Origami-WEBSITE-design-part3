                    Origami is the traditional Japanese game of folding elaborately designed paper into a myriad of shapes, typically plants, animals, and other living things.
                    <br>
                    Part of what makes origami unique is the fact that it simply requires a piece of paper and a creative imagination.

                    Japanese origami began sometime after Buddhist monks carried paper to Japan during the 6th century.
                    <br>
                    The first Japanese origami dates from this period and was used for religious ceremonial purposes only, due to the high price of paper.
                    <br>
                    There is also evidence of a cut and folded paper box from 1440.
